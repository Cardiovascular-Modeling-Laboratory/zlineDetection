% ACTINDETECTION - automaticly detect actin alignment in cardiomyocytes
% stained with phalloidin by filtering and calculation oreintation vectors
%
% Arguments:
%             Images of phaloidin stained actin captured from the
%               same cover slip under the same exact aquisition conditions,
%               file should TIF format grayscale at least 8-bit depth
%
% Returns:    Binary skeleton images of restored sarcomeres for each image
%
%             Binary skeleton images of restored actin after ROI based
%               removal of non-sarcomeres for each image
%
%             *.actinOrientation.mat file containing actin alignment
